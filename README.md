I have make a jarvis using pytho.
It includes function like 
1.Image generation 
2.Whether
3.Alarm
4.volume and brightness set by only Speaking
5.open anything
6.Fetch the latest news
And many more....
so if you want to make it come to any code editor 
and then inatall all the requirment for it 
then you have to just paste .env and main.py file and then
you have to insert your all api key then you
are set.
